## Introduction
This project shows how to build and evaluate a simple linear regression model in Python using the `scikit-learn` library. It includes:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training the model on the training data.
- Evaluating its performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared (RÂ²)**.
- Visualizing the actual vs predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset includes various features of laptops such as:

Brand

RAM

Processor

Storage

Screen Size

Graphics Card

Price (target variable)
